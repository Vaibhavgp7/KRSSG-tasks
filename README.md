# KRSSG-tasks
I was only able to do Task1 ,Task2 and and the first part of Task3. In the Task4 and Task5, I did the installation but could not complete the task.

# Task 1:
 Open a terminal window and first execute the command 'python3 casino.py'. 
 Open another terminal and execute command 'python3 client1.py'.
 A socket connection will be established and then enter the number of players and number of rounds to be played in the second terminal.
 Now open the same number of terminals as the number of players and type in each one the command 'python3 player.py'.
 The number of rounds will be played simultaneously in all using multithreading and the winner of each round and winner(s) of the whole game will be displayed in the first terminal.


 
# Task 2:
 Open a terminal and execute the command "python3 traffic.py".
 Now open a new terminal and execute the command 'python3 client2.py'.
 Enter the number of queries in the second terminal and then enter the input at time step1 connsisting of 8 1 and 0s.They should be space separated. Example :'1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0'.Total length of input is 
 15 (8 digits and 7 spaces.).
 In the first terminal the output for time step1 will be displayed.
 One by one enter the input in the second terminal till the number of queries and see the result at each time step in the first terminal.
 If all the queries are entered, in the first terminal , the output will be displayed in the first terminal.
 
 
 
 
 
# Task 3:
 Open a terminal and execute the command 'python3 RRT*1.py' for generating the path in first image.
 You need to wait for 30 seconds and then the path will be displayed in Open CV.
 
 Execute the command 'python3 RRT*2.py' for generating the path in the second image.
 It will ask for source number and destination number .You need to enter any number in 0,1 or 2 for each of them.
 Wait for 2 minutes and then the path will be displayed in OpenCV GUI.
